      "value": "<p>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.</p><p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p><section class=\"secret foundry-note\" id=\"secret-bTTAXItqCqmVPlTG\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Edit the Details for this feat, so that the damage type, saving throw, and area of effect match those of your Draconic Ancestry.</p></section>",
